This is the miniproject of an online blackboard. The users conect and see a
text area which is possible to edit and if an user edits all others see the edition 
in real time.

It only works correctly in chromium but maybe with a few changes would work in firefox.

known issues:
My test server blocked us because it thought that we were bots. To avoid this I've changed
the time between XMLHttpRequests from 500ms to 1500ms in the file static/functions.js
I can't test if it works because I'm blocked for now! :(

Aquest és el miniprojecte d'una pissarra colaborativa entre usuaris. Els usuaris es
conecten a la pàgina i veuen les modificacions en temps real que fan els altres. Ells 
també poden editar el text.
